**WARNING: THIS SPECIFICATION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. ANY VARIABLE, ROUTE, PARAMETER, RELEASE CAN CHANGE AT ANY TIME.**

## Overview

Indigo is the next generation of BlockCypher's Blockchain APIs. Built with simplicity and reliability in mind. The Indigo API is specified in the [OpenAPI 3.0 format](https://www.openapis.org). 

Requests and responses can be crafted with auto-generated code using [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen) or [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech). 

Moreover, the `api.json` file on the [Releases page](https://github.com/blockcypher/indigo-specifications/releases) can be imported directly into Postman for easy debugging and testing.

## Installation

No installation is required, as the repository only includes specification files.

## Documentation

As of today, the documentation is still under construction. But once finished, it will be available on [BlockCypher website](https://www.blockcypher.com/dev/v2/indigo.html). 

## Specification Development

We have designed several commands to help you check your code:

* `make deps` to install dependencies
* `make gen` to generate the specification files
* `make check-valid` to ensure specification is valid
* `make release` to check if code passes all tests run by GitHub Actions
* `make bundle` create a bundled `api.json` file from `api.yaml`
